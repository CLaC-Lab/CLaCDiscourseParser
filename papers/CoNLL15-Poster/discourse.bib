The paper provides a corpus analysis and a method for emiautomatic detection of such cases. Results show that discourse connectives are not translated into comparable forms (or even any form at all), in up to 18\% of human reference translations from English to French or German. In machine translation, this happens much less frequently (up to 8\%
only). Work in progress aims to capture this natural implicitation of discourse connectives in current statistical machine translation models.},
